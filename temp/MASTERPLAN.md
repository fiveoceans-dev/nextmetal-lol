# 🚀 Master Plan: League of Legends Autonomy as a Step Toward AGI

*First-principles blueprint in the spirit of SpaceX/Tesla: build the minimum system that bends physics, compute, and data toward inevitable capability.*

## 🎯 Mission in One Sentence

Deliver a superhuman League of Legends AI that operates end-to-end—from photons to actions—in <10ms, learns continuously, never tilts, and serves as a proving ground for general intelligence.

**Principle:** If it works in LoL’s chaotic multi-agent arena, it generalizes everywhere else.

**Guardrails:** Research-only, Riot-compliant, human-in-the-loop by default.

## 🏗️ Three-Stage Intelligence Stack

| System | Role | Musk-Style Constraint | Output |
|--------|------|----------------------|--------|
| **🎥 Watch-Mode** | Harvest expert signal without friction | Zero-configuration capture; privacy baked-in | Clean, aligned, multimodal trajectories |
| **🧠 Developer-Mode** | Convert data into accelerating intelligence | Training cost per Elo ↓ every week | Continually improving foundation policies |
| **🎮 Game-Mode** | Deploy intelligence with sub-10ms latency | Latency ceiling hard-capped; no excuses | Human-indistinguishable, superhuman agent |

**Flow:** Human Expertise → Watch-Mode → Developer-Mode → Game-Mode → Self-play flywheel → Better intelligence → Repeat.

## 🔑 Design Tenets (Elon Edition)

- **Physics first:** Optimize for latency, bandwidth, and thermal limits before model complexity.
- **Simplicity > cleverness:** Reduce abstractions until every millisecond is explainable.
- **Relentless iteration:** Weekly capability jumps measured by Elo and cost-per-Elo.
- **Closed-loop telemetry:** Every decision is profiled, audited, and fed back into training.
- **Alignment at the boundary:** Hard constitutional rules; human override always available.

## 🧠 Technology Stack

| Layer | Stack | Why it wins |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Deep Learning** | PyTorch + JAX | Flexibility + compilation where it matters |
| **RL & Self-Play** | Ray RLlib + custom lightweight loops | Distributed scale without ops drag |
| **Vision & Multimodal** | Detectron2, CLIP-style encoders | Robust perception under visual chaos |
| **Serving** | TorchServe + ONNX Runtime + TensorRT | Deterministic, low-jitter inference |
| **Orchestration** | Kubernetes + Ray + W&B/MLflow | Proven at scale, debuggable in minutes |

Specialized intelligence: CV-driven state extraction, transformer temporal cores, graph coordination, hierarchical RL for macro/micro fusion.

## 🎯 Milestones (Aggressive, Testable)

- **T+30 days:** Watch-Mode streaming with automated quality scoring; <100ms end-to-end ingest.
- **T+60 days:** Developer-Mode baseline surpasses diamond Elo in offline eval; cost-per-1k games down 20% week-over-week.
- **T+90 days:** Game-Mode prototype playing full matches autonomously with <15ms loop.
- **T+180 days:** Consistent pro-tier performance; transparent strategy explanations; safety envelope validated.
- **T+365 days:** Self-improving agents beating coordinated 5-stacks; transferable policies to other MOBAs.

KPIs: Elo delta/week, cost-per-Elo, median/99p latency, safety incidents = 0, alignment score >0.98.

## 🔬 Innovation Vectors

- **Multimodal fusion that never drifts:** Vision + inputs + audio + telemetry fused with continuous calibration.
- **Adversarial self-play:** Curriculum that always keeps the agent uncomfortable.
- **Meta-learning at the edge:** One patch, one game—instant adaptation without retrain.
- **Human-AI collaboration:** Coach modes that raise human winrate and reveal latent strategies.

Safety/Alignment: Constitutional policies enforced in serving path; anomaly detection; red-team adversarial tests every release.

*We are not building a toy bot. We are pressure-testing a path to AGI in the harshest multiplayer arena available—and doing it with engineering discipline, alignment, and speed.*
